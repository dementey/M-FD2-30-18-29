# SimpleTown

Built to entertain my 2 year old by letting her place little houses by tapping on a tablet screen. Closer to a sticker book than anything sim city like.

I'm also using this as an excuse to play with svgs and abusing a message bus to go overboard with event based architechture to see where it gets me.
